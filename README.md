✈️ Flight Booking Frontend (Angular) 

This repository contains the frontend application for a flight-booking platform (Italian website) built with Angular.
The system supports two types of users:

1. Normal Users – can register, log in, browse available flights, and book them.

2. Flight Companies – can register, log in, create new flights, and update flight prices.

Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to all protected resources within the application.
